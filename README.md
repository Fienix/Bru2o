## Synopsis
This application aims to create a web-based service for creating, storing and retrieving water profiles for homebrewers.
## Motivation
As a homebrewer, I am always looking for ways to improve my beer. When I made the switch to all grain, messing with my water chemistry
wasn't far behind. I started out using Excel spreadsheets, but quickly learned that this wasn't manageable and my calculations and 
additions were hard to view on mobile devices. So the thought of keeping all my water profiles in one, cloud-based location seemed helpful.

## To Do
- Localized Timestamps
- Delete > Modal
- Add Beer Styles
- Save Starting Water Profiles
- Help Tips for Recommended Ranges
- Use Water Profile without Registering
- Loosen Registration Requirements

## Future Features
